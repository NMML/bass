NEWS for R package, BASS

Objects for conducting analysis of aerial survey data (including spatial grid and covariate
information) are now formulated using the knitr file "create_BOSS_grids.Rnw" located in the
bass/bass/inst directory.  This file intersperses text (suitable for LaTeX compilation) together
with code, and can be executed directly in an environment such as Rstudio.  Note that access to
AFSC/NMML network drives is required to run all the code as it pulls in ice imagery data from
those locations.  For those interested
in the procedures used to generate data, who do not necessarily need to execute the code, see 
"create_BOSS_grids.pdf".  There are additional details about projections, ice imagery, etc. provided in 
"IceData_readme.pdf," also in the inst directory (this was written by J. London).  The inst directory
also includes some .Rdat files that include relevant data for 

  (1) The Alaska portion of the Bering Sea in 2012 (4/4/12-5/14/12) "AlaskaBeringData.Rdat"
  (2) The entire Bering Sea in 2012 (4/4/12-5/14/12) "BeringData.Rdat"
  (3) The Okhotsk in 2012 (4/4/12-5/14/12) "Okhotsk_Grid_2012.Rdat"
  
There are also some shapefiles included in the inst directory that provide grid layers for the Bering and 
Okhotsk.
